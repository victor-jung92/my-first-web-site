  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" title="html5 W3C URL">HyperText Markup Language</a> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
